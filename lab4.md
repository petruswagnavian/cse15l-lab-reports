Keys pressed: I typed `ssh pew017@ieng6.ucsd.edu`, and then pressed `<enter>`.

The command run is an `ssh` command that logs into the student `ieng6` account. Because I am set up to SSH using keys for `ieng6`, a password is not required. The `<enter>` keypress simply runs the command in bash.

Step 5: Clone your fork of the respository from your Github account (using the `SSH` URL)

Keys pressed: I typed `git clone`, and then pasted in the `SSH` URL of the fork in my repository by pressing `<ctrl>+v`, and then pressed `<enter>`.

The command run is the `git clone` command that clones the repository specified. In this case, the `SSH` URL is specified, which clones the fork I created of the respository. `<ctrl>+v` pastes the URL in, and the `<enter>` keypress simply runs the command in bash.



Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

Step 7: Edit the code file to fix the failing test

Step 8: Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
