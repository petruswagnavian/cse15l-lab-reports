1a. cd (no arguments)

- The working directory when this command was run was: /home/lecture1/messages
- The command "cd" without any arguments changes the current working directory to the home directory. This is the same function as the command "cd ~". So the output does nothing but change the current working directory to: /home. If the current working directory when the command was run already was /home, then the command would not do anything. The command "cd" having no arguments means that there is not a specified given path for the current working directory to change to, so it changes to the home directory.
- The output is not an error.
1b. cd messages/ (path to directory)

- The working directory when this command was run was: /home/lecture1
- The command "cd messages/" changes the current working directory to the given path, which is to: messages/. "messages" is a directory, or folder, and since it was the argument for the command "cd" that was run, the current working directory changed to that path.
